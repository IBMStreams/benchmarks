##README --  IBMStreams/benchmarks

The IBMStreams benchmarks project contains performance benchmark applications for IBM InfoSphere Streams.

Each benchmark is in a separate directory.

The project contains the following two benchmarks:

1.  Email Processing Application using Infosphere Streams
2.  Email Processing Application using Apache Storm
3.  Linear Road Benchmark Application using IBM Streams

Detailed instructions are present on the Wiki here:

These two benchmarks were used as part of this performance analysis report:

Linear Road Benchmark Application was built using a publicly available specification developed by MIT, Brown, Brandeis and Stanford.
