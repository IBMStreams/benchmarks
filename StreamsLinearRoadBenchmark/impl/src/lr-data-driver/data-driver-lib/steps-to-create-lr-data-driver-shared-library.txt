Before doing anything with the IBM Streams Linear Road application, libLRDataProvider.so file must be created by following the steps described below:

1) In a terminal window, ensure that you are in the following directory.
   StreamsLinearRoadBenchmark/impl/src/lr-data-driver/data-driver-lib

2) Run the following command to compile the LR data driver:

   g++ -g -O3 -Wall -fPIC -D_REENTRANT -c LRDataProvider.cpp MemTuples.cpp Tuple.cpp

3) Run the following command to create a LR data driver shared object library:

   g++ -shared -o libLRDataProvider.so MemTuples.o Tuple.o LRDataProvider.o

4) Run the following commands to move the newly created .so file to the correct impl/lib directory:

   mkdir  ../../../lib
   mv ./libLRDataProvider.so ../../../lib
